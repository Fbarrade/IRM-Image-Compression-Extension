# IRM-Image-Compression-Extension
## Overview:
This repository contains the source code for an extension named "irm" designed for lossless image compression. The project aims to implement a compression algorithm inspired by existing formats like BMP and PNG, incorporating techniques such as Huffman coding. The readme provides an overview of the project, instructions for usage, and insights into future development.

## Features:

-Implementation of lossless image compression using Huffman coding.
-Ability to compress images without loss of data.
-Potential for further optimization and extension.
## Usage:

1-Clone the repository to your local machine.
2-Navigate to the project directory.
3-Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.
4-Run the compression algorithm on the desired image file using the provided commands.
5-Evaluate the compressed image for quality and file size reduction.
## Contributing:
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork the repository, make improvements, and submit pull requests. Please ensure that any changes align with the project goals and coding standards.

## Future Development:

-Explore additional compression techniques for improved efficiency.
-Implement support for other image formats.
-Enhance the user interface for better usability.
